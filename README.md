# SF Jedi
Another tool to abstract the Force.com metadata API using JSforce. Ideally this
shall provide an ultra-simple cli and allow for abstraction via grunt tasks to
perform some useful functionality such as:
- Allowing one project folder for all the meta data to sync up with git
- Init, Push, Pull and Watch functions.
- Change tracking to allow push of only changed objects
- Pull of current state from org, excluding locally changed
- Watch files, to auto push changes as they occur up to some org

## Acknowledgements
Will add this section to acknowledge all projects used for inspiration
