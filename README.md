# Grunt SF Jedi
A grunt wrapper around a soon to be existing Force.com tool to push and pull
changes. More to come...

## Acknowledgements
The inspiration for this was the work done by James Kent on his
grunt-force-developer plugins. I wanted to go further with that but decided to
rebuild the project
